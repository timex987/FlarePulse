    "output": "For smart contract chains Axelar's solution is nice from a technical standpoint. I'm unsure about their solution for XRP as I can't find any details on how they adapt the standard Axelar model for XRPLs multisig constraint of 32 signers and hence I don't yet understand the security model of the Axelar integration. It's clear however that in general LayerZero/Stargate have decisively won in terms of usage, adoption and liquidity. Thankfully XRP and other FAssets (BTC & DOGE) will be able to access the Stargate ecosystem through Flare."

    "output": "I'm at a loss as to why this would be interesting. Ripple needs an oracle so that RLUSD can be used in lending protocols on Ethereum. Flare doesn't provide oracles to other networks yet. It's something that may come but there are much bigger opportunities to pursue first: FAssets and native staking for XRP and BTC to name but two."

    "output": "I understand that it looks like the market is going in the wrong direction but zoom out. Billions of dollars of value are assigned to things that often seem frivolous, such as art works, jewellery and fashion. There is no reason to think that the same human impulses that give these items value will not also be at play in a decentralized setting. Flare exists to allow people to build what they wish in the best way possible with maximum decentralization, whether that is perps on a hot meme coin, institutional finance or the future of AI. We are here for all of it."

My post was simply to highlight that if you hold large amounts of value or plan to, you should take the couple of hours to understand how to use a hardware wallet. Flare has great guides for this and we will be posting more of them in the next few days."

This doesn't change the fact that Ethereum currently boasts the most advanced DeFi ecosystem among blockchains, by far. But, I like to think of Ethereum as Europe in the 1500s: it has the right technology to utilize resources, but those resources are scarce and overutilized. To me, it's almost non-negotiable that we'll see new ventures like to that of New World explorations, bringing resources and assets from beyond Ethereum to make it the undeniable center of DeFi markets. This graph presents the current story, but I will be deep diving into this with an X article very soon. Chain abstraction's primary goal should be to make blockchains like Ethereum to be the center marketplace for restaking, lending, borrowing, and most of DeFi without any bridging complexity from other blockchains.",
